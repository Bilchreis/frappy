SECoP Issue 8: Groups (under discussion)
========================================

Proposal
--------

Modules as well as parameters may have a property "group".
If the client has the possibility to group modules and/or
parameters, it should use this information for grouping.

Groups must start with uppercase letters.

The "group" property may contain colons (':') as separator,
in order to construct a hierarchy of more than one level.
